Rebuilt carousel component from scratch. Carried out the following manual testing during development:

### Test 1 - Using the 'next' and 'previous' carousel buttons to update the 'current-card' class in the DOM.

| Component | Intended function | Works as intended? | Fix |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | --- |
| **Carousel Next Button** | Removes 'current-card' class from the element that has it and adds it to that element's next sibling. | Yes, but throws error when class is on last sibling | Remove button from DOM when there are no further siblings left. |
| **Carousel Previous Button** | Removes 'current-card' class from the element that has it and adds it to that element's previous sibling. | Yes, but throws error when class is on first sibling | Remove button from DOM when there are no previous siblings. |

### Test 2 - Using the 'next' and 'previous' carousel buttons to show next/previous card

| Component | Intended function | Works as intended? | Fix |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | --- |
| **Carousel Next Button** | Transitions to the next card of the carousel. | Yes | N/A |
| **Carousel Previous Button** | Transitions to the previous card of the carousel. | Yes | N/A |
