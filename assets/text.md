## "...I'm always excited to start practicing."

### When asked about VirtuaLearn, piano student Anna had this to say:

"I had been learning piano with a private tutor for about six months when I mentioned I was feeling unmotivated with my practice. My tutor suggested I use VirtuaLearn for the games related to music reading and rhythm - and I've never looked back. Since discovering the games and exercises from VirtuaLearn, I'm always excited to start practicing."

"...and I've never looked back."

## "VirtuaLearn has helped my class develop a love for traditional subjects."

### Primary school teacher Maria had this to say about VirtuaLearn's educational programs:

"With so much technology available to children these days, my class absolutely loved practicing their english and maths skills using VirtuaLearn's software. They were able to concentrate for much longer when compared to traditional worksheets and, when it came to the SAT exams, they scored one of the best class averages in the county. Thank you VirtuaLearn!"

"Thank you VirtuaLearn!"

## "The VirtuaLearn software gives my teaching business a competitive edge..."

"Parents of students always want to feel like they are getting the best value for their money and VirtuaLearn gives them that. I'm able to set specific homeworks so that my students have fun learning the stuff that is often boring, in fact, they have so much fun that many parents have decided to take lessons as well! The VirtuaLearn software gives my business a competitive edge that has helped me to grow my income."
