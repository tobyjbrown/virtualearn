## "...I'm always excited to start practicing."

### When asked about VirtuaLearn, piano student Anna had this to say:

"I had been learning piano with a private tutor for about six months when I mentioned I was feeling unmotivated with my practice. My tutor suggested I use VirtuaLearn for the games related to music reading and rhythm - and I've never looked back. Since discovering the games and exercises from VirtuaLearn, I'm always excited to start practicing."

"...and I've never looked back."

Thank you VirtuaLearn!"
